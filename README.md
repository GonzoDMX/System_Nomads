# Intégration et devellopement sur systèmes nomades

Project for a university course. It involves training and then deploying a machine learning image classifier inference on a raspberry pi. Tools used include Tensorflow 2, OpenCV, SQLite3, Raspberry Pi with camera as well as a HC-SR04 Ultrasound sensor. The basic Idea is that when the ultrasound detects an object a photo is taken. The machine learning model then looks for faces and identifies them. The results are saved to a database. A client can review contents of the database remotely via a webserver running on the raspberry pi.
